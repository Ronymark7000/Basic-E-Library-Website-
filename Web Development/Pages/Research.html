		        	The website Home page is created very simple and user friendly. The home page was made 
		        	by taking reference from the website Pacific Atrocities Education.<br>(link: 
		        	<a href=" https://www.pacificatrocities.org/" style="color:#7882A4 ;">https//www.pacificatrocities.org</a>

		       			<br><br>
		       		The position of the divisions, navigation bar's placement, and footer section in the webpage was depicted out here on the home page. The navigation bar is located in the header area and connects to the various webpages of the website. Because the Navigation Bar is at the top, the main body comprises a simple background image with a link to the product page and a JavaScript-created time clock. At the bottom of the page, in the footer section, there is a copyright statement confirming the website's ownership.
		       			<br><br>
		       		In conclusion the home page serves as an introduction to the website. As to keep it simple and user-friendly, not much is added to the respective homepage.

		       		).
		       			<br><br>
		       		The style of the book display, as well as its description, provided inspiration for the webpage on the Product page. As in the home page the navigation bar is set at the header part. The first part of the body section is a JavaScript-based image slider. The books are then displayed, together with a description of the book and the author's name.

		       		).
		       			<br><br>
		       		The fundamental motivation for the Research page was the idea of putting the referenced webpage alongside the actual webpage and writing its explanation below. The navigation bar is located in the header. The referenced website image and the actual webpage picture with its information are both in the body section. And the footer section caontains the store's copyright.
		       			<br><br>

		       		). 
		       			<br><br>
		       		Here in the Contact Us page, the main source of inspiration was the method of illustrating the division of the feedback form. The navigation bar was conatined by the header. Then, in the body section, two divisions were created side by side, with the store contact information on the left and the feedback form, which was produced with JavaScript, on the right. Then the webpage's footer section is same as the above webpages.
		       			<br><br>
		       		By applying contrasting colors, the webpage is kept basic and less complicated than the referred website. The main source of inspiration was the website's layout.
