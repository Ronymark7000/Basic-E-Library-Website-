					<br>
				<h1> Technology</h1>
					<br>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Almost every element of 21st-century living is influenced by technology, from transportation efficiency and safety to food and healthcare availability, sociability, and productivity. The internet's power has made it easier to build worldwide communities and share ideas and resources. Overuse of some technologies, on the other hand, has been related to a loss in mental health, increased social divisiveness, and concerns about privacy.
				</p>

				<h1> Technological Influence on the Society</h1>
					<br>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Digital technologies have advanced more rapidly than any innovation in our history – reaching around 50 per cent of the developing world’s population in only two decades and transforming societies. By enhancing connectivity, financial inclusion, access to trade and public services, technology can be a great equaliser.
						<br><br>
					Learning is one component of technology that has had a significant impact on society. Learning has become more interactive and collaborative, allowing people to better engage with the topics they are learning and having difficulty with. It also improves your access to resources. With the invention of the internet, we now have access to information at all hours of the day and night, and you can find practically anything online. It also makes it easy for pupils to complete their assignments. Students can take quizzes and exams more readily, and teachers can hold more productive online classes. It also pushes the classroom's boundaries, encouraging self-paced learning. Learning can be accessed via YouTube and social media. This is beneficial to students.
				</p>

					<br><br><hr size="3px"><br>

				<h1> Positive Impact of Technology</h1>
					<br>
				<p class="paragraph">
					1. Enhances Learning
						<br><br>
					Technology has grown more integrated into the classroom in recent years to improve children's learning experiences. Smartboards, document cameras, Apple TVs, and even 3D printers are now being used in educational settings to increase cooperation and involve students in the learning process. Teachers and students have greater creativity and project-based learning opportunities as a result of improved classroom cooperation, making academic education more relevant.
						<br><br>
					2. Fosters Problem-Solving Skills
						<br><br>
					These technologies need children to work autonomously in order to reach a certain goal. They are confronted with a variety of hurdles and challenges during the process, which they must learn to manage and overcome. As a result, they'll be encouraged to come up with their own problem-solving solutions when confronted with real-life situations like schoolwork difficulties, arguments with friends, or personal hardship, as well as technological challenges.
						<br><br>
					3. Develops Future Technological Leaders
						<br><br>
					With huge digital businesses like Amazon continuously adding hundreds of new jobs across the country, teaching children technical skills at a young age can help them prepare for a bright future. Jobs in technology are available right now. Jobs in technology will be available tomorrow. Some of today's technology will become tomorrow's technology, while some of tomorrow's technology will be wholly new to our planet. Who will be the most qualified to fill such positions? Those that begin learning right now.
				</p>

					<br><br><hr size="3px"><br>

				<h1> Negative Impact of Technology</h1>
					<br>
				<p class="paragraph">
					1. Diminishes Relationships and Social Skills
						<br><br>
					As youngsters become more reliant on mobile devices, they are more likely to be digitally connected with family and friends than than physically spending time with them; they are more likely to text, chat on social media, or interact through online games than to meet them in person.
						<br><br>
					2. Stimulates Health Issues
						<br><br>
					Children spend less time outside playing, running, and burning calories as they spend more time in front of those screens—mostly on the couch. These practices can lead to severe weight gain and other health issues over time.
						<br><br>
					3. Reduces Sleep Quality
						<br><br>
					Depending on their age, children under the age of 13 require 11-14 hours of sleep. For children, sleep is critical because it promotes growth, improves heart health, influences weight, increases attention span, and even improves learning. When youngsters do not obtain the recommended amount of sleep each night, however, these vital traits can decline.
						<br><br>
					Technology, like many other things that children enjoy, such as pizza or candy, may be wonderful—but only in moderation. Misuse and a lack of attention to how much technology is "too much" are the disadvantages linked with technology. Make sure to supervise and limit your children's use of technology so that they can benefit from it!
